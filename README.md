Highest priority right now is getting together the routing and CSS/HTML docs so that we can
put up baseline pages. I have the routes picked out in the app page, and am working on the frontend styling.

Things to get online ASAP rocky will be User Auth and the Chat. 

Things we need to do:

**Calendar (calendar)**
- Requirements:
    - Users can add events to the calendar
    - Calendar displays all current events for this month
    - Can switch to year long view (non-essential)

**Chat capabilities (chat) **
 - Requirements:
    - All logged on users can type messages and see them pop up in real time
    - Users know who typed which message

**Message Board (tips)**
  - Requirements:
    - Users can leave a message on the board and it will display
    - Users can view the messages currently on the board
    - Users can comment on each message

**Style and CSS**

**Login/User Auth (login)**
  - Requirements:
    - Users can login with their pass/username
    - Users can change their info
    - Users can go through a process to get a new identity    

**Roster (roster)**
  - Requirements:
    - Users can view the roster of the club
